### OnDemand Variant Creation Idea
- so that there isn't hundreds of variants for the system to handle
- A user lands on a product detail page ->
  - If the variant they select hasn't been created yet, create it
  - Keep a que of ten or so of the last or most popular created variants


### Pricing Calculator Idea
OptionVariant
- has a series of options which independently modify the end price

Option
- A number of modifiable form inputs that will result in a price change
- A number of dependencies which will modify how
- A function to act as the Calculator to find out its net price
- Each option doesn't know the price of other options
    - Only knows the key:value
